# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
This project included an analysis of ride-sharing data for the company PyBer. It was to see the difference in fares of each type of city such as urban, suburban and rural cities. We use matplotlib to plot a visual aid for the data to make it easier to see from the dataframe.     
## Results and Summary 
From the graph, we see that the urban cities would have the highest total fare while the rural cities would have the least amount. This left suburban cities in between both. The difference would make sense because the rural cities have the least amount of drivers and as well as rides completed. Meanwhile, the urban cities have the most in both categories. We also saw that the fares however, were inversed as the urban cities would have cheaper fares than rural cities. In order of urban, suburban and rural, the average fare price is at $16.57, $30.97 and $39.50 per ride. This would possibly be due to the distance traveled, as in urban cities, the rides are generally shorter and quicker leading to a increase in volume. The rural cities however, seem to have longer trips causing for a higher fare, and could also be because of higher rates since there aren't as many drivers either.
